Comb Sort improves Bubble Sort by quickly eliminating turtles, and it's more efficient for larger datasets. While it has better performance than Bubble Sort, it doesn't generally match more advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort, especially for very large datasets.

### Comb Sort
```plaintext
function combSort(array)
    arrayLength = length(array)  // Get the number of elements in the array
    gap = arrayLength  // Initialize gap size
    shrinkFactor = 1.3  // Set the shrinking factor (commonly used value)
    isSorted = false  // Initially, the array is not sorted

    // Continue combing until the array is sorted
    while not isSorted
        // Calculate new gap
        gap = floor(gap / shrinkFactor)
        if gap <= 1
            gap = 1
            isSorted = true  // Assume sorted if gap is 1

        // Compare and swap elements with 'gap' distance
        i = 0
        while i + gap < arrayLength
            if array[i] > array[i + gap]
                swap(array[i], array[i + gap])
                isSorted = false  // If a swap is done, array may not be sorted
            i = i + 1
    // The array is now sorted
    return array
```
**Explanation:**
- **arrayLength = length(array)**: Determine the size of the array.
- **gap = arrayLength**: Initialize the gap size. The gap size starts as the length of the array and is reduced in each iteration.
- **shrinkFactor = 1.3**: Define the shrinking factor for the gap. The value 1.3 is commonly used and has been experimentally found to work well.
- **while not isSorted**: Continue the algorithm until the array is sorted.
- **gap = floor(gap / shrinkFactor)**: Reduce the gap size using the shrink factor.
- **if gap <= 1**: If the gap becomes 1 or less, the next pass will be the final pass (similar to a Bubble Sort pass).
- **while i + gap < arrayLength**: Compare elements that are `gap` distance apart.
- **if array[i] > array[i + gap]**: If elements are out of order, swap them.
- **isSorted = false**: If any swap happens, set `isSorted` to false, as we need to check the sortedness again.
